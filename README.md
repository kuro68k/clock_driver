# clock_driver
Shift register based clock display driver.

This is the core driver code for an LED based clock display. The hardware uses shift registers (TLC5928 for current sink, MIC5891 for current source) to drive common cathode or common anode displays. Seven/fourteen segment, dot matrix or pretty much any other type of multiplexed display is possible.

Hardware to follow, currently untested.
